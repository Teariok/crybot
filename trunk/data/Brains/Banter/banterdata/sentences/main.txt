# basic sentences

# each line contains one sentence
# do not wrap long lines or paragraphs onto multiple lines or it will be broken up into multiple sentences

# you should always have a MAIN sentence type, since Banter defaults to this if there is an error with the other types

# you can make any kind of sentences you want
# add any text you want to the sentences and any number of key words (the things in all caps)

# you can have blank lines to make your text more readable
# you can have comments wherever you like

# the words in capital letters with *'s on both sides are your key words that will be replaced with random words from
# word lists you define
# the names of the key words are up to you
