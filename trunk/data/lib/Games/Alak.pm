=head1 NAME

Games::Alak -- simple game-tree implementation of a gomoku-like game

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  % perl -MGames::Alak -e Games::Alak::play
   ...Or just run Alak.pm as if it were a program...
   ...Program responds with output, and a prompt:
  
  Lookahead set to 3.  I am X, you are O.
  Enter h for help
  X moves from 1 to 5, yielding .xxxx..oooo
  alak>
   ...and now you enter the commands to play.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a simple game-tree system for the computer to
play against the user in a game of Alak.  You can just play the game
for fun; or you can use this module as a starting point for
understanding game trees (and implementing smarter strategy -- the
module's current logic is fairly simple-minded), particularly after
reading my I<Perl Journal> #18 article on trees, which discusses this
module's implementation of game trees as an example of general
tree-shaped data structures.

=head1 RULES

Alak was invented by the mathematician A. K.  Dewdney, and described
in his 1984 book I<Planiverse>. The rules of Alak are simple -- at
least as I've (mis?)understood them and implemented them here:

* Alak is a two-player game played on a one-dimensional board with
eleven slots on it.  Each slot can hold at most one piece at a time.
There's two kinds of pieces, which I represent here as "x" and "o" --
x's belong to one player (called X -- that's the computer), o's to the
other (called O -- that's you).

* The initial configuration of the board is:

   xxxx___oooo
   
For sake of reference, the slots are numbered from 1 (on the left) to
11 (on the right), and X always has the first move.

* The players take turns moving.  At each turn, each player can move
only one piece, once.  (This is unlike checkers, where you move one piece
per move but get to keep moving it if you jump an your opponent's
piece.) A player cannot pass up on his turn.  A player can move any one
of his pieces to the next unoccupied slot to its right or left, which
may involve jumping over occupied slots.  A player cannot move a piece
off the side of the board.

* If a move creates a pattern where the opponent's pieces are
surrounded, on both sides, by two pieces of the mover's color (with no
intervening unoccupied blank slot), then those surrounded pieces are
removed from the board.

* The goal of the game is to remove all of your opponent's pieces, at
which point the game ends.  Removing all-but-one ends the game as
well, since the opponent can't surround you with one piece, and so will
always lose within a few moves anyway.

=head1 SAMPLE GAME

A game between X (computer) and a particularly dim O (human):

  xxxx___oooo
    ^         Move 1: X moves from 3 (shown with caret) to 5
               (Note that any of X's pieces could move, but
               that the only place they could move to is 5.)
  xx_xx__oooo
          ^   Move 2: O moves from 9 to 7.
  xx_xx_oo_oo
     ^        Move 3: X moves from 4 to 6.
  xx__xxoo_oo
           ^  Move 4: O (stupidly) moves from 10 to 9.
  xx__xxooo_o
      ^       Move 5: X moves from 5 to 10, making the board
              "xx___xoooxo".  The three o's that X just
              surrounded are removed. 
  xx___x___xo
              O has only one piece, so has lost.

=head1 INTERFACE

This module uses C<Term::ReadLine> to give you a prompt at which you
can type commands.

Entering "h" for help at that prompt will give instructions on how
to interact with the game.

When in doubt, consult the source -- it's made to be fairly clear.
